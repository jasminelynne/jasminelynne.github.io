                <article><h2>Women's Rights</h2>
        <h3>Why It Is Important</h3>  
        <p>Women are misjudged worldwide and mistreated by others. Women have less educational privileges which gives them less knowledge of things. Women are stereotyped to be housewives that do not have a strong, educational workplace. Society set standards for women about how they need to look, dress, and treat men which gives them the idea that they need to cook and clean for family and men. Women are not objects that you can treat as puppets, dressing them up, and giving them commands about what to do and what not to do. Women do not want to be treated like puppets. They are strong individuals who want to have self confidence, and their voices be heard, but women are scared to stand up for themselves, not knowing the outcome. </p>

                        <li>Girls are not valued as much as boys - they are seen as a burden on their family</li>
          </ul>

            <article><h3>Important Women Who Took a Stance</h3>
        <p> Malala went through this troubled time in Pakistan. The Taliban was rebelling against women and girl's schools. They bombed most schools, and made strict rules for women and their family. One rule was that they must have a male relative or a husband each and every time women step out of the house. They must also wear a hijab, a headscarf used to cover the hair and neck. At a young child, she did secret news writings that informed people about her feeling about the Taliban's threats and about destroying girls schools. She grew and started doing interviews and winning awards in her teenage years. Her and her family had to leave the area because things kept progressing to get worse and worse. On October 9, 2012, a gunman shot Malala when she was traveling home from school. She survived and has continued to speak out on the importance of education. In October 2014, at age 17 Malala Yousafzai became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Malala Yousafzai is a well-respected women who stood up for women's education.</p>
