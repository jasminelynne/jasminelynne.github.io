                <h2>Women's Rights</h2>
        <h3>Why It Is Important</h3>  
        <p>Women are misjudged worldwide and mistreated by others. Women had less educational privileges which gives them less knowlege of things, which gives them the ability to cook and clean for family and men. Women are stereotyped to be housewives that do not have a strong, educational workplace. </p>

        <h3>Girls, Not Brides</h3>
         <ul>
                        <li>Each year, 15 million girls are married before the age of 18. That is 28 girls every minute, and 1 every 2 seconds</li>
                        <li>Child marriage is any formal marriage or informal union where one or both of the parties are under 18 years of age</li>
                        <li>Child marriage is rooted in gender inequality and the belief that girls and women are somehow inferior to boys and men</li>
                        <li> Poverty, lack of education, cultural practices, and insecurity fuel and sustain the practice</li>
                        <li>Girls are not valued as much as boys - they are seen as a burden on their family</li>
                        <li></li>
