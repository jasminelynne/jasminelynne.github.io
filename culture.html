        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I love traveling and exploring new places. I like learning about different cultures and lifestyles that others do everyday. Being out in the water paddle boarding or surfing is a way to clear my mind, and forget everything that is happening around me. </p>

        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p> I am an only child, yet I have 14 cousins and counting that I consider my younger siblings. Together, we go to the park, go on boba runs, and other bonding activities. </p>
