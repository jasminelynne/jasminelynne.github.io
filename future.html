                <h2>My Future</h2>
        <h3>High School</h3>
        <p>I am still deciding between Millikan Quest and Poly Pace. Both are amazing programs that I am very interested. They both have great AP classes and teachers that I would be thrilled to join.</p>

        <h3>College</h3>
        <p> I donâ€™t have a set college that I would want to go to, but I am starting to look at University of Hawaii or just a college out of the country. I would want to travel and explore new surroundings.  </p>

        <h3>Career Interest</h3>
        <p>When I am older, I would want to make robot prosthetics and help others. I do not like dealing with physical, gushing blood, but I feel better when I significantly accomplish something for others. </p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p> My goal is to be happy and take negative people out of my life. A big thing for me is self confidence and living a happy life, so that is one of my main focuses. It has the umbrella effect over schools, grades, and even a career. I connects because if I have those things, and do them right, then I would be happy and would have a relaxed lifestyle. I have a small group of friends that I trust and rely on. They always have my back and no matter what.</p>
