		<h2>My Future</h2>

		<h3>High School</h3>
			<p>I am still deciding between Millikan Quest and Poly Pace. Both are amazing programs that I am very interested. They both have great AP classes and teachers that I would be thrilled to join.</center></a></p>

			<center><p>I donâ€™t have a set college that I would want to go to, but I am starting to look at University of Hawaii or just a college out of the country. I would want to travel and explore new surroundings.</center></p>

		<center><h3>Career Interests</h3>
			<p>When I am older, I would want to make robot prosthetics and help others. I do not like dealing with physical, gushing blood, but I feel better when I significantly accomplish something for others.</center></p>

		<center><h3>Goals</h3>
			<p> My goal is to be happy and take negative people out of my life. A big thing for me is living a happy life, and that is one of my main focuses. It has the umbrella effect over schools, grades, and even a career. I connects because if I have those things, and do them right, then I would be happy and would have a relaxed lifestyle. I have a small group of friends that I trust and rely on. My best friends always have my back no matter what.</a>
