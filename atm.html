       <h3>6th Grade</h3>
        <p>In 6th grade, we really focused on typing at a faster pace and knowing all of the leetters without having to look down at them. In addition to that, we also experiment with coding art and made different kinds of animals and objects in Khan Academy. We also learned how to design newsletters in Microsoft Words. To make sure we are safe on the interent, we learned lots about cyber safety and they cause and effects about it. We made sure we weren't going off of sites that could possibly give the computer a virus, or come in contact with any stranger on the internet.</p>

       <article> <h3>7th Grade</h3>
        <p> During 7th grade, I learned how to operate Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketchup, In Design, and Floorpanner. In photoshop, we played around with different effects and learned multiple tools to use. In In Design, we created a magazine from scratch and learned how to make it look perfessional. In sketchup, we learned how to create furniture from scratch and make it look 3D. Not only did we learn how to desing furniture, but we also designed houses and other tiny details. We learned how to create logos in Illustrator during 7th grade. Last but definitely not least, we worked in Floorplanner where we scaled down a classroom in Bancroft Middle School. We measured different lengths of the classroom and scaled the size.</p>

        <article><center><h3>8th Grade</h3>
        <p> Though I have not been in 8th grade for a long time, I stll have learned so much! Already, I am advanced in HTML and CSS coding. We used different websites that taught us lessons, such as Dash, Khan Academy and Visual Studio Code. In addition to coding, there is a humongous difference when I fist typed in 6th grade, and how fast I type now. I can type around 57 WPM during a 5 minute typing test. </p>
